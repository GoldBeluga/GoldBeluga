- Java, C#, C, Python, etc. are all high-level languages, C++ is an intermediate language, and can also become a high-level language, Assembly is a low-level language, and machine language is understandable by machines. In the past, programmers used machine language to write programs. Since machine language is basically binary and runs directly with the CPU, it is very complicated. Later, people designed the assembly language (Assembly Language), but the assembly language is also hard. Thatâ€™s why the high-level language was invented because it dealt with the body, memory, and central processing unit. Generally, Java can be used as Android App, Objective-C and Swift can be used as ISO App, then C# and C++ can be used as games, and C++, SQL, and Python can be used as backends (but Python is not so good, so it is not recommended to learn Python ). Generally, the aggregation language is used as Kernel. If you want to make an OS, you need to know a low-level language and a high-level language, such as the aggregation language and C++.
------
- Since Python is too slow, it is not very recommended. Although YouTube's backend is made in Python, Python is useless
------
- If you want to do a database, you can use SQL
- JavaScript, CSS, HTML 5 are for web pages
- Java can be the backend of web pages
------
- If you want to open a web page on the Java backend, you only need the IPv4 of that server.
------
- If you want to learn, what do you want to do? If you want to make an Android app, learn Kotlin or Java; if you want to make a game, you can learn C#, and then learn C++; if you want to make a web page, learn JavaScript, CSS and HTML 5, HTML 5 and CSS are not programming languages, because they donâ€™t have functions. Code
------
- You may ask, the machine only understands machine language, so how to run Java, C++, etc., in fact, we can use the compiler. If you use Java, you can use Eclipse. Eclipse is the environment where the IDE is written in Java, and then the Java Code will be turned into a collection language, and then the machine language, so that the machine can understand
